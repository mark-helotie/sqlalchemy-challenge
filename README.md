# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

# Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.

This repository contains the following files:

**Module10_Challenge.docx** == the FULL and detailed instruction set for this entire challenge.

Under the "SurfsUp" folder --

**1_climate_starter.ipynb** == the Jupyter notebook for Part 1.
**2_app.py** == the Python script that spawns a local Flask session in a web browser for Part 2.

The "Resources" folder contains the CSV files and the SQLLite file which gets imported.
